Log of what I'm doing

Added a dictionary of masses to be called in the functions.
Fixed the way that masses are being inputted into the formulas.
Fixed the way g_star and g_starS are being taken.
Changed the Planck mass from 1MeV to 21.76 micrograms or 1.2206x10^22 MeV
Added a second Y_eq function for when x << 3. Previously was using the Y_eq function for x >> 3 even when dealing with small values.
Tinkered with some functions and tried outputting number density and getting Y_eq that way.
